It's goal is to produce allele specific copy information across the genome using matched tumor and normal samples, sequenced with whole-exome sequencing (WES).  It is a produce of the Cancer Genome Analysis (CGA) group at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. \r\n\r\n### Placeholder\r\n\r\nThis page is currently a placeholder until the publication is finalized, at which point the source code will become publicly available.
